  <p>  Despite its island setting, New York City does not utilize much of its 520-mile coastline these days. There are a number of reasons for this: goods are shipped via truck, not boat; the city is reluctant to give out permits for floating structures; and, perhaps most importantly, much of the water’s edge has been constructed and built up to the point of inaccessibility. It doesn’t help that the waters are so notoriously polluted that New Yorkers avoid the waterways. </p>
<p>This is what Tim Gilman-Sevcik, Executive Director at the RETI Center, a climate resiliency nonprofit based in Red Hook, Brooklyn, calls the “water-land binary,” which keeps residents from engaging with waterways. Increasing access to waterways, many New York-based advocates argue, would create a sense of community around New York’s waterways. Embracing the natural geography of the city would, in turn, enhance the city’s climate adaptation. </p>
<p>Illustrated below are the 63 points identified by New York City as water access points. They include mostly parks, some of which allow New Yorkers to actually touch the water; others are walkways or “visual corridors” near waterways. </p>
